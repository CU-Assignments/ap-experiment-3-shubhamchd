# Linked List Problems 

## Overview

This repository contains solutions for six common linked list problems in C++. The solutions cover different operations on linked lists, such as merging, sorting, rotating, reversing, detecting cycles, and removing duplicates.

## Problems Solved

1. **Merge k Sorted Lists**  
   Merges `k` sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list using a priority queue.

2. **Sort a Linked List**  
   Sorts a linked list in ascending order by storing values in a vector and sorting them.

3. **Rotate a Linked List**  
   Rotates a linked list to the right by `k` positions.

4. **Reverse a Linked List Between Two Positions**  
   Reverses the portion of the list between two given positions (`left` and `right`).

5. **Detect Cycle in a Linked List**  
   Detects whether a linked list contains a cycle using Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding algorithm.

6. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted List**  
   Removes duplicate values from a sorted linked list.
